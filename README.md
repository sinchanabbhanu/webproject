In this repository, we have implemented PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and BootStrap to create a Event Management system to make it easy and simple for the administrator
to allow or deny permissions from the faculty in regards to booking of a venue. The faculty is able to keep track of his allocated venue event. We have made slot booking 
much simpler and disable the slots of venue which are already booked to the max for any given day and time.
